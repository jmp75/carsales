A package for personal use, to buy a car. Shopping around is a drudgery, so I may as well take the opportunity to learn a few things with R and make it a bit more fun, and possibly save a few bucks.

If you happen to reuse this; the package contains some web harvesting code. Though it is not necessarily readily usable, you may be using this as a starting point to harvest data from a car sales web sites. If so, it is up to *YOU* to make sure you comply with the conditions of use of the web site.
